# Method
>
> Four (out of many) processes influencing forest reorganization: 
>
> disturbance sizes, disturbance frequency, seed availability, sapling height growth
>
> These processes are impacted by climate change (increased disturbance activity, decreased regeneration success) → climate-mediated process deterioration
>
> How much process deterioration can the system take before “breaking”?
>

>
> Study concept:
>
> Why not deteriorate processes artificially (“process modification”, 3 deterioration levels each)?
>
> “Breaking the system”: change compared to *reference* level, for composition proportion of landscape where *dominant species changed* [dominance based on IV, %] and for structure proportion of landscape where *basal area decreased by more than 50 %* [%] compared to reference 
> 
> Additional indicator: regime shift (count/ha < 50 trees)
> 
*Reference*: value under reference conditions (no process modification + baseline climate, rep 1), calculated for each RU and each year


# Results (13.05.2024)

## Q1: How do the 4 investigated processes influence system breakage? Who is most important?

## Q2: Is the impact of the processes modulated by changing climatic conditions or independent?

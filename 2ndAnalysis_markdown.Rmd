# Results for Berchtesgaden (19.04.2024)

## System breaking indicators

Short recap of our indicators:

1. Structure: basal area decreased by >50 % from reference

2. Composition: dominant species changed from reference

3. Remaining forest: stem density dropped below 50 trees/ha

*Reference*: value under reference conditions (no process modification + baseline climate, rep 1), calculated for each RU and each year


### Indicators over time

>
> Structure changes very quickly until mid of century, then recovers under hot-dry climate, and continues to change under baseline climate, lowest value ~15%
>
> Composition changes continuously for both baseline and hot-dry conditions, lowest value ~50%
>
> Very little forest loss, lowest value ~90 %

## Spatial patterns

### Single indicators

![](results/figures/diagnostics/map_singleIndicators_bgd.png)

1. Composition: highest probability of change in higher elevations (above: baseline climate, below: hot-dry climate)

2. Structure: highest probability of change at tree line, under baseline also in lower elevations 

3. Forest loss: highest probability of change at tree line


### Reorganization

* Resilience: no structural or compositional change, no regime shift

* Reassembly: compositional change, no structural change or regime shift

* Restructuring: structural change, no compositional change or regime shift

* Replacement: structural change and compositional change, no regime shift

* Regime shift: regime shift

![](results/figures/diagnostics/map_reorganization_bgd.png)

Overall very little loss of resilience, most activity around tree line. Bit more replacement under hot-dry climate.


## Landscape wide changes

### Mean basal area 


* Basal area varied across the simulation period and runs:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_bgd.png)


* Basal area only consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100 once the disturbance rate was increased by more than 25. Under hot-dry conditions it even took a disturbance rate increase of x100:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_finalBasalArea_disturbances_bgd.png)


### Species composition


* Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row) and differences between the climate scenarios were small. (Interesting! I would have expected spruce to decrease due to higher temperatures under hot-dry but it still seems to do fairly well without climate change-mediated disturbance change)


* Under the most extreme scenario (size * 10 and frequency * 10 and fecundity/10 and browsing * 10, second row) spruce decreased while all other species increased - especially larch (makes sense, it should be able to do very well in all those disturbance patches). Fir also benefited from the increase in disturbances:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_relative_extremes_bgd.png)


* Absolute basal area decreased strongly under the extreme scenario:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_bgd.png)


* Closer look at spruce: its proportion really remains fairly stable under hot-dry climate as long as the disturbance regime doesn't change much from reference conditions

### Basal area killed


* Basal area killed was very similar between the climate scenarios:

## Spatial patterns

### Single indicators

![](results/figures/diagnostics/map_singleIndicators_stoko.png)

1. Composition:  generally more change at tree line and in certain elevation bands (above: baseline climate, below: hot-dry climate)

2. Structure: highest probability of change in higher elevations

3. Forest loss: highest probability of change at tree line


### Reorganization

* Baseline: Restructuring in higher elevations and replacement at tree line. Diffuse reassembly in lower elevations

* Hot-dry: Replacement at tree line, reassembly across elevational gradient

## Landscape wide changes

### Mean basal area 


* Basal area differed strongly between baseline and hot-dry climate. Disturbance modification (colored lines) did not have an impact:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_stoko.png)


* For baseline climate, basal area only consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100 once regeneration was severely impeded. Under hot-dry conditions final basal area consistently surpassed the 2020-value:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_finalBasalArea_regeneration_stoko.png)


### Species composition


* Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row). Differences between the climate scenarios started showing in the later half of the century.


* Under hot-dry conditions *Betula ermanii* decreased most strongly as *Alnus ssp.* increased. Differences between the process modification scenarios were small:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_relative_extremes_stoko.png)


* Absolute basal area increased strongly under hot-dry conditions in the first half of the century, but leveled off under the extreme process modification scenario:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_stoko.png)


* Closer look at *Betula ermanii*: its proportion remained fairly stable under baseline and decreased strongly under hot-dry climate. Modifications of the disturbance regime had very little to no impact on its abundance: 


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_mostCommonSpecies_overTime_stoko.png)



### Basal area killed


* Basal area killed was higher under hot-dry climate. Under hot-dry climate it also increased over time (more trees on the landscape -> more trees to kill):

Short recap of our indicators:

1. Structure: basal area decreased by >50 % from reference

2. Composition: dominant species changed from reference

3. Remaining forest: stem density dropped below 50 trees/ha

*Reference*: value under reference conditions (no process modification + baseline climate), calculated for each RU and each year

## Spatial patterns

### Single indicators

![](results/figures/diagnostics/map_singleIndicators_grte.png)

1. Composition: higher probability of change in lower elevations 

2. Structure: high probability of change pretty much everywhere

3. Forest loss: high probability of change basically everywhere



### Reorganization

* Replacement basically everywhere. Higher elevations more resilient against reassembly (only restructuring)

![](results/figures/diagnostics/map_reorganization_grte.png)


## Landscape wide changes

### Mean basal area 


* Basal area varied strongly across different disturbance modification scenarios but only differed slightly between baseline and hot-dry climate:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_grte.png)


* Basal area consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100. Basal area drops super low under the disturbance modification scenarios - basically 0 once disturbance rate is increased by more than factor 5:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_finalBasalArea_disturbances_grte.png)


### Species composition


* Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row). Differences between the climate scenarios were small but added up over the simulation period.


* Under the extreme process modification scenario *Populus tremula* and *Pseudotsuga menziensii glauca* increased to the detriment of *Pinus contorta*:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_relative_extremes_grte.png)


* Absolute basal area dropped to nearly zero under the extreme process modification scenarios:


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_grte.png)


* Closer look at *Pinus contorta*, the originally dominant species: its proportion really remains fairly stable under baseline and hot-dry climate. Different disturbance modification scenarios had different impacts on its abundance. Once disturbance rate was increased by more than a factor of 10, it started to decrease: 


![](results/figures/diagnostics/landscapeWide_mostCommonSpecies_overTime_grte.png)



### Basal area killed


* Basal area killed decreased under the disturbance modification scenarios as less trees were available for killing. Basically no differences between baseline and hot-dry climate:

> * New modification levels: size x c(1,2,5,10), frequency x c(1,2,5,10), fecundity x c(1,1/2,1/5,1/10), browsing pressure x c(1,2,5,10)
> * New output: dynamic stand in year 2020, 2050 and 2100
> * Severity for all agents set to 90 % (and 100 for sapling during fire)

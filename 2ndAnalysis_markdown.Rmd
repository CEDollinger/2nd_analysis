# Preliminary results (29.02.2024)

> I implemented all the changes we talked about in our last meeting:
> 
> * Instead of manipulating *sapStressThreshold* we now manipulate height growth (simulated via the browsing module, same browsing probability for all species)
> * New modification levels: size x c(1,2,5,10), frequency x c(1,2,5,10), fecundity x c(1,1/2,1/5,1/10), browsing pressure x c(1,2,5,10)
> * New output: dynamic stand in year 2020, 2050 and 2100
> * Severity for all agents set to 90 % (and 100 for sapling during fire)
> * Fire can only burn cells with a fuel load > 500 kg/ha
> 
> I then ran a complete suite of simulations for Berchtesgaden (4 patch size levels * 4 disturbance frequency levels * 4 fecundity levels * 4 browsing levels * 2 climate scenarios * 1 rep = 512 runs)
>
> Here are the results!

## System breaking indicators

Short recap of our indicators:

1. Structure: basal area decreased by >50 % from reference

2. Composition: dominant species changed from reference

3. Remaining forest: stem density dropped below 50 trees/ha

*Reference*: value under reference conditions (no process modification + baseline climate), calculated for each RU and each year


### Indicators over time

![](results/figures/lineplot_overtime_bgd_notbroken - Kopie.png)

>
> Structure changes very quickly until mid of century, then recovers under hot-dry climate, and continues to change under baseline climate, lowest value ~15%
>
> Composition changes continuously for both baseline and hot-dry conditions, lowest value ~50%
>
> Very little forest loss, lowest value ~90 %
>


### Structure compared between the scenarios

Values in year 2100

>  
> All processes play a role in structural change, disturbance processes (first row) however seem to have a bigger impact (relatively little change at modification level 1)
> 
> More structural change under baseline climate

### Composition compared between the scenarios

Values in year 2100

>  
> Mainly the disturbance processes (first row) seem to have an impact on compositional change (relatively little change at modification level 1) - especially under modification level 10
> 
> Compositional change similar under baseline and hot-dry climate

### Forest loss compared between the scenarios

Values in year 2100

## Spatial patterns


1. Structure: highest probability of change in higher elevations (left: baseline climate, right: hot-dry climate)

## Landscape wide changes

### Mean basal area 


* Basal area varied across the simulation period and runs (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management):


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_bgd.png)


* Basal area only consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100 once the disturbance rate was increased by more than 25. Under hot-dry conditions it even took a disturbance rate increase of x100.

### Species composition


 * Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row) and differences between the climate scenarios were small. (Interesting! I would have expected spruce to decrease due to higher temperatures under hot-dry but it still seems to do fairly well without climate change-mediated disturbance change)


* Under the most extreme scenario (size * 10 + frequency * 10 + fecundity/10 + browsing * 10, second row) spruce decreased while all other species increased - especially larch (makes sense, it should be able to do very well in all those disturbance patches). Fir also benefited from the increase in disturbances:

* Absolute basal area decreased strongly under the extreme scenario:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_bgd.png)


* Closer look at spruce: its proportion really remains fairly stable under hot-dry climate as long as the disturbance regime doesn't change much from reference conditions (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management)

### Trees killed


* The disturbance modules (black line in baseline facet) kills more trees than our reference disturbance regime (maybe because our assumed severity of 90% of susceptible trees is too low as wind events usually have higher severities?)


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_treesKilled_bgd.png)


* Basal area killed is very similar between the climate scenarios.

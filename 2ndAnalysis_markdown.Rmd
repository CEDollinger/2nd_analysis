# Preliminary results for Berchtesgaden (29.02.2024)

## System breaking indicators

Short recap of our indicators:

1. Structure: basal area decreased by >50 % from reference

2. Composition: dominant species changed from reference

3. Remaining forest: stem density dropped below 50 trees/ha

*Reference*: value under reference conditions (no process modification + baseline climate), calculated for each RU and each year


### Indicators over time

> Composition changes continuously for both baseline and hot-dry conditions, lowest value ~50%

## Landscape wide changes

### Mean basal area 


* Basal area varied across the simulation period and runs (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management):


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_bgd.png)


* Basal area only consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100 once the disturbance rate was increased by more than 25. Under hot-dry conditions it even took a disturbance rate increase of x100:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_finalBasalArea_disturbances_bgd.png)


### Species composition


 * Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row) and differences between the climate scenarios were small. (Interesting! I would have expected spruce to decrease due to higher temperatures under hot-dry but it still seems to do fairly well without climate change-mediated disturbance change)


* Under the most extreme scenario (size * 10 + frequency * 10 + fecundity/10 + browsing * 10, second row) spruce decreased while all other species increased - especially larch (makes sense, it should be able to do very well in all those disturbance patches). Fir also benefited from the increase in disturbances:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_relative_extremes_bgd.png)


* Absolute basal area decreased strongly under the extreme scenario:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_bgd.png)


* Closer look at spruce: its proportion really remains fairly stable under hot-dry climate as long as the disturbance regime doesn't change much from reference conditions (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management)


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_mostCommonSpecies_overTime_bgd.png)



### Basal area killed


* The disturbance modules (bark beetle + wind; black line in baseline facet) kill more basal area than our reference disturbance regime (maybe because our assumed severity of 90% of susceptible trees is too low as wind events usually have higher severities?):


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_treesKilled_bgd.png)


* Basal area killed was very similar between the climate scenarios.

## Landscape wide changes

### Mean basal area 


* Basal area varied slightly across the simulation period and runs and differed strongly between baseline and hot-dry climate (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management):


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_stoko.png)


* For baseline climate basal area only consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100 once regeneration was severely impeded. Under hot-dry conditions final basal area consistently surpassed the 2020-value:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_finalBasalArea_regeneration_stoko.png)


### Species composition


 * Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row). Differences between the climate scenarios started showing in the later half of the century.


* Under hot-dry conditions *Betula ermanii* decreased most strongly while *Alnus ssp.* increased in turn. Differences between the process modification scenarios were small:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_relative_extremes_stoko.png)


* Absolute basal area increased strongly under hot-dry conditions in the first half of the century, but leveled off under the extreme process modification scenario:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_stoko.png)


* Closer look at *Betula ermanii*: its proportion really remains fairly stable under baseline and decreased strongly under hot-dry climate. Modifications of the disturbance regime had very little impact on its abundance (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management)


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_mostCommonSpecies_overTime_stoko.png)



### Basal area killed


* The wind module (black line in baseline facet) kills about the same amount of basal area as our reference disturbance regime:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_treesKilled_stoko.png)


* Basal area killed was higher under hot-dry climate:

## Spatial patterns


1. Structure: high probability of change pretty much everywhere, at least under baseline climate (left)


![](results/figures/map_prop_basal80_baseline_grte.png){width=49%}
![](results/figures/map_prop_basal80_hotdry_grte.png){width=49%}



2. Composition: higher probability of change in lower elevations

* Basal area varied strongly across the simulation period, and runs but only differed slightly between baseline and hot-dry climate (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management):


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_basalArea_overTime_grte.png)


* Basal area consistently dropped below the 2020-value in 2100. Somehow higher final basal area under disturbance rate x 100 (might be due to simulation error though, see above):


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_finalBasalArea_disturbances_grte.png)


### Species composition


 * Species composition remained relatively stable under reference conditions (= no process modification, first row). Differences between the climate scenarios were small but added up over the simulation period.


* Under the extreme process modification scenario *Populus tremula* increased at the detriment of *Pinus contorta*:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_relative_extremes_grte.png)


* Absolute basal area dropped to nearly zero under the extreme process modification scenario until mainly *Populus tremula* starts coming up again:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_speciesComposition_absolute_extremes_grte.png)


* Closer look at *Pinus contorta*, the originally dominant species: its proportion really remains fairly stable under baseline and decreased under hot-dry climate. Modifications of the disturbance regime generally had a negative impact on its abundance (Dotted red line: simulation with disturbances simulated via modules instead of management)


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_mostCommonSpecies_overTime_grte.png)



### Basal area killed


* The wind and fire modules (black line in baseline facet) kill about the same amount of basal area as our reference disturbance regime:


![](results/figures/landscapeWide_treesKilled_grte.png)


* Basal area killed was higher under hot-dry climate:
